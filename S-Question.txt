microserice architecture : Microservices are small, modular, and independently deployable services. 
A microservices architecture is a type of application architecture where the application is developed as a collection of services. It provides the framework to develop, deploy, and maintain microservices architecture diagrams and services independently.

Multithreading in C# is a process in which multiple threads work simultaneously. It is a process to achieve multitasking. It saves time because multiple tasks are being executed at a time. To create multithreaded application in C#, we need to use System.Threding namespace

A thread is defined as the execution path of a program. Each thread defines a unique flow of control. If your application involves complicated and time consuming operations, then it is often helpful to set different execution paths or threads, with each thread performing a particular job.

Parallel.ForEach loop runs on multiple threads and the processing takes place in a parallel manner.

SignalR is a free and open-source software library for Microsoft ASP.NET that allows server code to send asynchronous notifications to client-side web applications.
SignalR can be used to add any sort of "real-time" web functionality to your ASP.NET application.

IdentityServer is an authentication server that implements OpenID Connect (OIDC) and OAuth 2.0 standard for ASP.NET Core. It's designed to provide a common way to authenticate requests to all of your applications, whether they're web, native, mobile, or API endpoints

OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It allows Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an interoperable and REST-like manner.

OAuth 2.0 is the industry-standard protocol for authorization.

WCF ::
Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) is a framework for building service-oriented applications. Using WCF, you can send data as asynchronous messages from one service endpoint to another. A service endpoint can be part of a continuously available service hosted by IIS, or it can be a service hosted in an application.
